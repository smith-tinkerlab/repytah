    "# The Transform Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The `transform` module of the `ah` package holds functions used to transform matrix inputs into different forms that are of use in bigger functions where they are called. These functions focus mainly on overlapping repeated structures and annotation markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `transform` module includes the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **remove_overlaps**: Removes any pairs of repeats with the same length and annotation marker where at least one pair of repeats overlap in time\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\_\\_create_anno_remove_overlaps**: Marks rows of repeats with annotation markers for the start indices and zeroes otherwise. After removing the annotations that have overlaps, creates separate array for annotations with overlaps and annotations without overlaps. Finally, the annotation markers are checked and fixed if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\_\\_separate_anno_markers**: Expands vector of non-overlapping repeats into a matrix representation. The matrix representation is a visual record of where all of the repeats in a song start and end.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions in the `ah` package are meant to be used alongside other functions in the package, so many examples use functions from multiple modules. In the examples below, the following functions from the [`utilities`](https://github.com/smith-tinkerlab/ah/blob/master/aligned-hierarchies/utilities.py) module are called:\n",
    "- `add_annotations`\n",
    "- `reconstruct_full_block`\n",
    "\n",
    "For more in depth information on the function calls, an example function pipeline is shown below. Functions from the current module are shown in green.\n",
